# LED 8 Blink - Arduino Project 🚀

This is a basic Arduino project to blink 8 LEDs using digital pins 2 to 9.

## 🔧 Components Used:
- Arduino UNO
- 8x LEDs
- 8x 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard + jumper wires

## 💻 Code Highlights:
- `digitalWrite()` to control LEDs
- `delay()` to time the blink
- Each LED turns ON and OFF every 1 second

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes:
- GPIO pin usage
- Breadboard wiring
- Debugging real circuits
