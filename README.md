# 🔆 LED 8 Blink – Arduino Mini Project 🚀

Hey there! This is a basic but cool Arduino project where I made **8 LEDs blink** in sync using digital pins 2 to 9.  
It helped me understand how to work with GPIO pins and troubleshoot real circuit issues.  
Pretty fun and full of learning moments! 😄

## 🧰 Components I Used:

- Arduino UNO board
- 8x Red LEDs
- 8x 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable for power

## ⚡ Circuit Connection Diagram:

Here’s how I wired it all up on the breadboard ⬇️

> Each LED is connected to digital pins 2 to 9 through a resistor, with the cathode going to GND.

## 💡 What This Project Does:

- All 8 LEDs turn **ON for 1 second**, then turn **OFF for 1 second**
- This blinking pattern continues in a loop
- Helps understand how `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, and `delay()` work in Arduino
